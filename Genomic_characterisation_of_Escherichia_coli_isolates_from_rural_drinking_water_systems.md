# Genomic characterisation of _Escherichia coli_ isolates from rural drinking water systems

## **Project**

Use of _E. coli_ in rural water quality monitoring involves two key uncertainties. First, to what extent is _E. coli_ in the distribution system linked to either human or livestock faecal contamination? Second, what are the health risk implications of changes in _E. coli_ concentration between PoC and PoU?

With these questions in mind, in this study _E. coli_ isolated from rural drinking water systems and household storage were whole genome sequenced to characterise each isolate to investigate the diversity of phylogroups and sequence types within and between systems and household storage. This detailed characterisation will provide insight into the occurrence of _E. coli_ in loosely controlled rural systems, allowing comparison between PoC and PoU _E. coli_, and informing discussion of health risk on the basis of _E. coli_ population structure in addition to aggregate concentration.

Use the raw sequence data to assemble the sequence data to generate the genomes of the isolates, identify the pan-genome and determine the phylogenetic grouping, multi-locus sequence types (MLSTs and Clermontyping) of the isolates and try and answer the question posed above.

## **Samples**

Nine water supply systems were selected in a rural region of central Kenya. Systems include a variety of types (borehole piped schemes, a surface reservoir (rock catchment) piped scheme, borehole handpumps, a dug well handpump, an open dug well, and a chlorinated utility supply (Table 1).
